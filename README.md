# tacoCat

## Parameters of the project:

1. Write a program that allows a user to enter a word or phrase and then prints the reverse of the input.
2. Create a feature that determines if the word or phrase is a palindrome.

## Additional Functionality

1. Create a feature that notifies the user that their input is invalid if they enter an empty string.
2. Create a feature that reads the string as a line of pure alphanumerical text without spaces or extra characters.
3. Normalize the case of the user's input so the application doesn't discriminate the difference between upper and lowercase.
